# The Math Repo
<p>
This site is a prototype of a <strong>thinking-centered math contest database</strong>, designed to support self-learners transitioning from beginner to intermediate levels.
Unlike traditional books or problem lists, problems here are organized by concepts needed and difficulties.
</p>

<h2>How to Use This Database</h2>
<ul>
  <li>Start from a concept you want to improve, or read the wiki about the concept you want to learn.</li>
  <li>Attempt the problem without reading the solution.</li>
  <li>Use hints selectively based on how stuck you are.</li>
  <li>Read the full solution after you solved it.</li>
</ul>

<h2>Sample Problem Page</h2>
<div class="card">
  <h3>2025 AMC 12A Problem 6</h3>
  <p>
    Six chairs are arranged around a round table. Two students and two teachers randomly select four of the chairs to sit in. What is the probability that the two students will sit in two adjacent chairs and the two teachers will also sit in two adjacent chairs?

<h2>Sustainability & Contribution</h2>
<p>
This project is designed to be <strong>sustainable and community-maintained</strong>. However, it remains closed source during testing on a pre-release version.
Future contributors can add problems by following a shared template:
</p>
<ol>
  <li>State the problem</li>
  <li>Adding the key hints.</li>
  <li>Add a full solution or link to the full solution.</li>
</ol>

<h2>About</h2>
<p>
This database was created to lower barriers to contest mathematics and help students learn how to think, not just what to solve.
It is intended to evolve as future students critique, expand, and improve its structure.
